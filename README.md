# MyMoodDiary
This is a diary that records every day's mood and experience.
Users only need to add their own mood or life experience through the + sign of the project to add their own mood.
The current user is still in the development stage, and the integrity of the test interface and the logical integrity of adding a mood diary are currently tested.
If you encounter any problems during use, please contact us
